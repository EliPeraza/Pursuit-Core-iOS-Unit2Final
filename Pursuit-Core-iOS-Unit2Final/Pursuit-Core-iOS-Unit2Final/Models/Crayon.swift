/*
 The following initializer will be helpful:
 
 UIColor(displayP3Red:green:blue:alpha:)
 All four arguments to the initializer are of type CGFloat and expect a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
 
 The doubles provided for the Crayon values are from 0 from 255. You will need to convert them proportionally to the appropriate CGFloat by dividing by 255. */
